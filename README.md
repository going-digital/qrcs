# QRCS
QRCS is a QR code cross-stitch pattern generator.

### How to use it
* Open up http://going-digital.github.io/qrcs
* Design your pattern, print it out if you fancy
* Stitch it. For cross-stitch, 14 count aida is ideal. Use a strong contrasting silk.

These codes also work with Fair Isle knitting, or papercrafting.

### Why is this special?
There are other QR code generators, but this one:
* Uses URL pre-processing to make more efficient codes.
* Maximises error correction for more reliable reads.
* Generates embroidery friendly charts.
* It works just fine on a smartphone.
